<h2 class="blog-post-title">Hi, I'm Matt. Nice to meet you!</h2>

I'm a husband, father of two, adventurer, and lifelong learner.

I was born in 1981 and have been programming since I was 11. My interests are pretty eclectic, usually focused on technology but ranging from foreign language and culture to Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

This blog is an evolving experiment in sharing my life, interests, and insights. New adventures are always in progress, so stay tuned for updates.
