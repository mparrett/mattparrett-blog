<h2 class="blog-post-title">Welcome! I'm Matt. <br/>Thanks for stopping by.</h2>
<br />
Ah yes, I've been told I should introduce myself. These days I'm a husband, father of two, technology enthusiast, adventurer, and lifelong learner.

My mom was kind enough to bring me into the world in 1981 and I've been programming since I was 11. My interests are pretty eclectic and usually focused on technology but range from foreign language and culture to Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

This blog is an unfinished but constantly evolving experiment in sharing my life, interests, and insights. It runs on a toy PHP framework of mine and these pages are rendered Markdown. You'll also probably find some of my early experiments with personal development and writing. They're pretty bad and I've been meaning to take them down. Things aren't quite right yet, so please excuse the mess. 

So yeah, life. What's the journey been like so far?
