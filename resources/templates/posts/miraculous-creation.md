Ok, I'm terrified to post this. But here goes. 

My heart seriously aches today. It aches for you, for me, and anyone who's ever felt like their worth was defined by anything other than the fact that they're a miraculous creation. Don't worry, I'm not trying to sell you on creationism. I want you to find the truth yourself. But know this: Your coming into this world was nothing short of miraculous. And beyond that, your life, right now, is a miracle. Ask science. Ask religion. Ask another person who knows who you really are.

I think that's it. Have a great weekend.
