This is the halfway point of my 90 day challenge.

Whew, I thought I might never write another post again.

My motivation to write faded a couple weeks in and I've left some of you hanging. (Thanks to those of you who reached out and asked how it was going!)

Yesterday marked the end of the first half of the challenge. 

Here are some stats:

- Total challenge days: 45
- Days taking cold showers: 36 (80%)
- Cold shower days skipped: 9 (20%)
- Cold showers taken: 37 (82%)
- Warm/hot shower taken: 0 (0%)
- Bonus cold water immersions: 3 (40-50Â°C @ 1-2min)
- Cold buckets of water thrown on me: 1
- Approximate minutes spent uncomfortably cold: 200 (3.33 hours)
- Approximate hours spent thinking, writing, or talking about taking cold showers: 10 (guess)

In my last half-hearted post I mentioned something like I wanted to "Learn more about myself in the second month". Scott warned me this was vague, and he was right. I don't know if I succeeded, but I did learn some lessons. Most of them aren't new. They just needed some reinforcement.

I'll be sharing about those soon. :)

After the first week, feeling pretty gung-ho, it seemed reasonable to start more challenges. Over the next few weeks I'd commit to 4. Not a joke. Little gung-ho perhaps. Little naive perhaps. It's not surprising none of those made it much further than a week. And I stressed about it a lot, because some of them were GREAT challenges. I'll share about that sometime.

I'm taking bolder steps than I used to. But it's possible to go overboard. Taking an honest appraisal of the landscape would have been wise. The fact that I have a newborn at home. And a son newly enrolled in daycare. And a new job. And everything else. Maybe it would have made sense to wait a few weeks before starting the cold showers. But all of these sounded like excuses at the time, so I arrogantly shut them out. And I was feeling weak and wanted to feel strong. Which is all very interesting, given the reality of the first lesson I'm going to share...

I'M DOING WHAT'S IMPORTANT WITHOUT HESITATING

versus

I'M WAITING FOR THE RIGHT TIME

Waiting for favorable conditions can be a way to procrastinate. It can be a sneaky way of avoiding doing what needs to be done. But acting in the face of less than ideal conditions is powerful. Even if it feels weird. Act quickly in the morning when willpower reserves are high.

I'M POURING ALL OF MYSELF INTO ONE THING

versus

I'M BURNING OUT SPREADING MYSELF WAY TOO THING

Keep it simple, especially if the challenge is demanding. Splitting your focus in too many places weakens efforts across the board.

I AM SO GLAD I'M NOT PERFECT, I AM SO GLAD TO BE LEARNING

versus

I AM FLAWED BECAUSE I MAKE MISTAKES, I AM SO GOOD I CAN'T MAKE A MISTAKE

Perfectionism runs deep. Ever since I started skipping days (procrastinating) my mind has been trying to persuade me that the whole thing is busted, to throw in the towel. If it can't be perfect, I'm better off quitting. WHAT?! It's okay to be imperfect. It's okay to stumble. In fact, if you've chosen a worthwhile challenge, wouldn't you expect this to happen? I got a strong mental image of learning to walk a slackline. You. Will. Fall. Over. And. Over. This is to be expected. It's how we learn. So we should be excited when we fall, because we just learned something.

I'M TAKING CARE OF MY AMAZING LIFE

We each have this body/mind/spirit. If you look closely and carefully, you know these are incredible gifts. When you have something amazing, is it not your responsibility to care for it? To appreciate it? To develop a flourishing and evolving relationship with it?

You need to plan for recuperation. This was never in my plan and I learned it the hard way by suffering total burn-out. We're all called to self-love and appreciation. When this is missing, it's no wonder we get out of balance.

Love is still my number one priority. Giving it, receiving it, feeling it, and appreciating it. Beyond that, awareness, truth and service. Hard to call these separate priorities because they're all intertwined. And more often than not, I'm letting my priorities slip.

I'm going to nail the second half of this challenge. I'm going to finish strong. And most importantly, I'm going to relax and do it one day at a time.
