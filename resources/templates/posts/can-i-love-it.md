"Can I love it?"

I keep asking myself this question.

When I see clutter on my desk. When I look at the dishes I've piled up in the sink. When both babies are screaming and I've had no sleep.

Sometimes my answer isn't "Yes" right away. I just stay with it. Sometimes I ask myself, "What if I loved it?" Eventually "Yes" comes. And it comes with a good reason.

Love always finds a way.

Why stand in its way?
