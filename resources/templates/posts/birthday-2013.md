I was just picking up some sandwiches from Baggin's, struggling to carry a baby, drinks, and a bag of sandwiches, when a random stranger approached. He insisted on helping me out to the car and then he was gone after a handshake. I didn't even get his name. 

Sometimes all it takes is one simple act of selfless kindness.

Right now I'm reminded of the hundreds of acts of kindness I've received this year alone. I'm happy to have grown a lot and accomplished many things, but it all pales in comparison to the love I've received. The truth is, I'd be nothing without love.

I'm incredibly blessed.

My life is wonderful not because of what I've done, but because of others. Sure, I do my part. I make a lot of mistakes and try to learn. But I'm supported by so many great people on this journey. I can't take the credit.

As I celebrate my 32nd birthday this year, I'll be celebrating yours as well.

Here's to another great year for us all!
