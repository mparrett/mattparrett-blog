I've been staying pretty busy and it's been awhile since I posted anything helpful. But I'm tired of waiting until I "have more time". 

-------

This year I chose to let go of a dear friend: "Someday."

I was comfortable in his presence, but time after time-- I was giving up on what mattered to me, because the timing was poor. And "Someday" it would be better.

I have a feeling you know my friend. Someday, when I have more money. Someday, when I have more time. Someday, when my health is better.

I'd like to introduce you to a new friend: Now.

Your new friend will help you stop putting things that matter to you off until a future date. Your new friend will sharpen your priorities. You'll make bolder decisions and either do or do not. 

When you shut someday out of your life, his friends will leave too: Maybe, Try, and If Only. Once they're gone, you'll be surprised they were ever a part of your life. Don't underestimate these characters. They'll knock on your window at 3am wanting to get back together.

The common saying goes, you are the average of your 5 closest friends. 

Who's in your mental top 5?
