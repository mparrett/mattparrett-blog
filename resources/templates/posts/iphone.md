iPhone came through in a pinch. 3% battery and no hope of charging. Got to wish Dad a happy birthday and show off Micah's keen ability to pack many ranch slathered fries into his mouth. My old LG would have shut down immediately upon attempting anything at below 8%. After several minutes of FaceTime (which worked pretty well over the mobile network), it survived for an additional hour at 1%, while I sent and received several text messages. Even made it to the charger. 

Conclusion: this iPhone is pretty good.
