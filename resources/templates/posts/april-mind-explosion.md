Ten megaton mind detonation. Phoenix rising from the ashes.

I'm terrified to share this, so here it is. 

I've always had a decent intellectual acknowledgement about money. Conceptually, it's neither good nor bad. It's just a currency. It's about movement and transaction. It makes people do weird things.

However, I was blind to my core beliefs about money. Deeply ingrained beliefs become invisible, like vision spots. Until you remove all the distractions, the brain just hides the pattern.

My deep belief was that money is associated with greed, corruption, evil, and badness. Some people do good things with money, but on the whole, it's a corrupting influence. I don't want to be a part of that.

I've been feeling very weird lately. Weird because foundational limiting beliefs were being dismantled, setting me adrift to find a deeper truth. I finally arrived at something. 

Money is a symbol. It's illusory, but it points to a deeper reality if you are willing to release the social conditioning and see beyond the visible.

From my new perspective, I no longer love or hate money. That said, I'm also not neutral in relation to it. I now love what money can reveal (without attachment to the money itself). It's a way (and sign) of showing and receiving appreciation. It's a blip on the radar that might reveal something. There are a lot of distractions and noise, so be careful not to misinterpret noise for signal. We don't see money this way in our conditioned culture.

I can't totally explain how this change came about, but a few things are certain. I meditated. I prayed. I let go. I took action. Fear and desire illuminated the way and took me to the truth. I was more attached to stuff and money than I thought. The ego puts up quite a fight when it's limbs are being pulled off.

I did an experiment. For the last few days, whenever I bought something, I radiated feelings of gratitude from a detached place. I focused on receiving something of value and showing appreciation for it. I took focus away from my status quo of giving away my prized resource for something that wasn't even worth it. It felt very weird, but I gave it a try. As a result, I finally experienced a radical shift in my internal perspective. All sorts of weird things started happening. Free meals, mysterious appearance (and disappearance) of money, etc. 

This is just the tip of the iceberg but I already feel lighter and less worried. Extremely excited to see what comes next.
