Little story about how a mental funk turned into something awesome.

Yesterday I was in a bad one and I didn't know why. I was chatting with my brother Rob Parrett and could only explain it felt like I needed to fight, or sleep, or do something differently. But I was totally blind to what was actually happening. I thought it might be physical.

First, some background. I had been hobbling around like an elderly man for what seems like at least 3 months. I had pretty much tuned out the chronic back pain. I'm a programmer, so I figured it was an ergonomics issue. Replaced my office chair, replaced the desk, adjusted everything. Felt better, but the chronic issue remained. I carry my son a lot, so I figured that was next to eliminate. Started being very careful picking him up, slowed down, etc. No luck. I then scaled back on jiu jitsu, doubled down on yoga, foam rolled like there was no tomorrow. Tried everything I knew to do on my own. Pain was still there, and getting worse.

Back to yesterday. Earlier, I had watched an episode of The Raw Truth About Entrepreneurship featuring Mike Hrostoski and Jonathan Mead. That video planted some seeds I was about to activate. I breathed super deeply (if you've watched the video, you know what I mean) and decided to break out of this physical prison, whatever that meant. Surgery? Sure, if it was necessary. I wouldn't just continue idly waiting for something to magically change. I was clearly doing something wrong and I needed help. I didn't know exactly how to start, but I took a walk outside and then asked for help on Facebook.

I got a ton of awesome responses -- thanks for those! But something even better unexpectedly happened.

Joe recommended a book, Pain Free by Pete Egoscue. Said it was a life changer. I thought I remembered reading something about it in Four Hour Body. I grabbed "Pain Free at the PC" by the same author from Amazon (on Kindle) and read the intro. A light bulb went off. Actually, a bomb.

This is that truth bomb: What if, instead of helping my body heal and recover, I was hurting it? My resting and careful avoidance of activities was actually feeding the imbalances and causing more dysfunction, which was manifesting itself as a chronic back/hip issue. My body needed movement, IMMEDIATELY. I was making things worse by staying still.

I decided right away to do an experiment. I started with a few cycles of something like a yoga sun salutation, some deep diaphragmatic breathing, and made contact with my body. Then I broke into some spontaneous burpees. Then shadow boxing, I continued to feel my whole body more deeply. I felt gravity and the connectedness from my soles to my scalp. I gradually increased the intensity until I was practicing wrestling shots and sprinting. My back DID NOT HURT ONE BIT. I picked up my son Micah (23 pounds or so right now) and some 5 gallon water bottles. I did "chop and lift" style movements with him. He loved the ride and MY BACK DID NOT HURT. 

I was now feeling a massive surge of energy. An idea connected with my reality. My back was going to be okay and I wasn't going to be crippled forever. Deep masculine stuff was bubbling up. I have a powerful body, and it's time to stop this crippled act. I wanted to fight a shark and a grizzly bear at the same time. 20 minutes later, I had actually exercised for the first time in months, while appreciating my body and what it's capable of. Really showed it some much-needed love. And when that months-long struggle was gone in an instant... Total mental, spiritual, and emotional release. 

I had turned a mole hill into a mountain. And then carried it on my back. Today, I went to Primero Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and trained some jiu jtisu. And I felt fine. I guess it pays to have great friends, be willing to ask for help, and change what isn't working.
