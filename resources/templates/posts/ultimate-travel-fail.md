3/2/14

Today I failed at traveling. I assure you this isn't a pity party, but I wanted to share. Because man, it's my-life-as-entertainment at its finest.

I leave late, despite waking at 4am. Then I get lost TWICE driving to the familiar airport... that I have driven to dozens of times without fail... in a car with GPS... and my iPhone giving turn by turn directions.

At the airport, I zoom over to check my bag. They're probably just boarding the plane, but I might make it. The kiosk shuts me out. The two United airlines agents are moments from meltdown. Widespread cancellations due to weather brought panicked customers from other airlines.

Bounced around at a few other airlines, nobody has anything getting to Denver on time. I just happen to check my original flight status and learn it's delayed. There's hope again! Back to the two poor souls.

Here's where it gets awesome. If I had printed my BOARDING PASS instead of just the e-ticket, I would have been able to proceed through security and to the gate, where the nice folks would have probably had mercy on me. But because I didn't... and because I can't make it to the oh-so-familiar airport on time... I'm stuck. The plane isn't leaving for 45 minutes, but I can't get on.

I appreciate a good challenge, so as a last ditch attempt, I purchase a refundable ticket on another flight from another airline just for the purpose of getting through security. This would have worked if I had the idea sooner. But after I get through security, I see the flight had been airborn for 8 minutes. Nice try but no dice.

Then I did the sane thing. I reached out to my co-workers for help, and they promptly got the flight rescheduled for tomorrow. Waaay less stressful than all the other stuff I tried since I left the house this morning.

The bad news is, I'll miss a day of important meetings and preparation. The good news is, I get to spend another night with my family. And depart tomorrow morning, peacefully, with a printed boarding pass.
