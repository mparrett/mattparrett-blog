My first jiu jitsu tournament was a blur that lasted 30 seconds. If you've never been in a fight, suffice to say it's an intense experience that demands everything you have to give. 

Sometimes life is this way. We get a promotion or start a new project, and all of a sudden everything's rushing at us. We aren't equipped and we struggle to survive. Soon we're gasping for air and the referee is raising our opponent's arm. All we can think is, what happened?

In jiu jitsu, you learn what to do if someone is choking you. You learn to stay calm. You learn about how to be victorious despite your circumstances.

It's not about being the biggest and strongest or being somehow better than the other person. It's not about building the biggest trophy collection. 

It's about showing up as the best version of yourself and continually learning and growing. It's about grace and poise and humility.

Sounds like life to me.

Can I ask a favor? 

I've been working on something very near and dear to my heart. Progress has been slow but I'm finally gaining momentum. It's time to bring it out of isolation. 

The first product we're releasing is a simple task manager.

Take a look, and if the idea resonates with you, I'd appreciate your sharing it with anyone that could benefit. I'm also accepting applications for beta testers if that's something you're interested in.

Thanks in advance!
