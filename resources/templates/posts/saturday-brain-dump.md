April 26th, 2014

I've been thinking about death and mortality a lot lately. Maybe because some of my friends have been talking about it a lot. Maybe because I'm saturated with new life coming at my from all angles.

I'll be 33 this year and right now and in some ways, it's hard to believe. My body's older, but I feel somehow younger inside. Like every moment is expanding, and every year brings more than the previous one did. Time is slowing down.

This could be a side effect of some of the brain supplements I'm taking. Or my strange dietary habits. Anyhow...

I'm overflowing with gratitude for life. 

I still have rough moments. Sometimes rough days. Or weeks. I'm only human. But something changed years ago, and a deeper sense of gratitude has never left me. There are certain truths I can't turn from. Like lights that can't be turned off, even if they can be momentarily obscured. 

This year, so many aspects of reality have moved from my mind to my heart. Concepts literally becoming experience... becoming reality.

If you would allow me to use a tired old agricultural metaphor, seeds that were planted long ago are starting to sprout. The whole garden is starting to blossom, and some of the plants are becoming quite mature. It feels like harvest time is right around the corner.

This alone is enough to leave me incredibly thankful.

But if this were all about me, I'd just write this in my journal. When good plants grow, they eventually produce seeds which are scattered and take root elsewhere. Or something like that. (I actually have no business using this metaphor as I don't know the first thing about plants or gardens or farming)

I won't lay claim to any of these ideas-- you can find them in ancient writings and scriptures and traditions across thousands of years of human history, across cultures. You'll find them in the collective consciousness of people that have truly tasted Life and have had their eyes opened. 

Personally I find these concepts to be quite transcendent. More like undeniable facts of life, inseparable from my experience. Beyond words, but words are the best we have. I didn't intend to produce a top 10 list of personal platitudes, but it sorta came out that way. Tidbits to be inserted into some graduation speech someday. Or maybe stolen from somewhere. Things are trite often because they're helpful. In any case, maybe this will help you find what you're looking for. Just seeds blowing in the wind.

**Here's what's on my mind as we approach May, 2014:**
1. Life is a gift. Or a curse, depending on your perspective. Try both and see which feels better, truer.
2. We get to choose our attitude and way of life. Why add negativity?
3. Our fears are usually exaggerated shadows on the wall. Turn the lights on them.
4. Joy, peace, and serenity are found now, not in the future or the past. Stop waiting to live and live already.
5. Words, lists, ideas, and concepts are pointers. Don't confuse them with reality.
6. Fortune favors the brave and persistent. Keep pushing for what's right and good.
7. True freedom is relinquishing the need to be free. Let go.
8. Being of service to others is the best way to serve yourself. As long as you're not doing it for yourself.
9. Our beliefs, attitudes, and habits determine our experience. Choose wisely.
10. There's no valid reason not to love everyone and everything. This includes yourself.

A few runners-up, that haven't yet sprouted...

- Anything in excess is toxic or cancerous. Yes, that includes introspection, philosophy, politics, and religion.
- Some amount of unpredictability, chaos, variation, and mystery is beneficial to life. Noone's body responds well to eating the same processed food every night. We get bored when we know all the answers. Stagnant water breed disease.
- Every virtue is sandwiched between opposing vices. For example: gluttony -- moderation -- starvation

Thanks for sticking with me. This concludes my Saturday brain dump. My heartfelt wish is that some of these words might point you in the right direction. Maybe stir some thoughts one way or another. Even if you don't agree. Even if they aren't necessarily true. Or good. You get the idea.

Good night, Facebook-world.
