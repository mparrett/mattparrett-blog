I love where this CHOICE thing is going. Life tossed me an awesome example this week.

We can't always choose what happens to us, but we CAN choose what it means.

Option A: 

Ugh, I just ruined a week's worth of precious free time by dropping my wife's irreplaceable earrings in the lint trap of the dryer. Can't believe it. Just my luck. I don't have time for this! Poor me. Klutz. Why is life so unfair? 

Option B: 

Magnets, mirrors, and duct tape for the WIN! I'm darn handy. I approach seemingly impossible problems with poise, patience, and creativity. My tank was empty and I still found gas. Any sleep deprived father could have fumbled. Still got the McGyver touch. Thanks for the reminder!

The truth is, I dropped some earrings in the dryer. It could have stopped there. But my mind likes to chatter. But I get to choose the rest of the story. Positive, negative, and neutral are options. Why not choose something positive?
