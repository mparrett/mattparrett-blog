THE LAST TIME I'M GOING TO SAY IT
I did a little thought experiment last week. If I only had a few days to live, what would I pass on to my children? I'm not sure if I got fully into the mindset of certain death, but I gave it a shot. Here's what I came up with. May this be an inspiration as we decide how to live in 2015 and beyond.
1. You are bigger than your circumstances, your thoughts, and your perceived limitations.
2. We choose our focus moment by moment, and that focus compounds over time. It's your choice whether you feel gratitude or lack.
3. You are capable of more than you think. You are more fortunate than you know. You are loved more than you understand. Your life will be bigger than you can currently imagine.
4. Everything's gonna be okay. It's way worse in imagination than in reality. If you get stuck, short circuit the suffering by deliberately imagining your worst case scenario times ten. Then realize that whatever happens, if you have your breath, and your mind, then you have another chance.
5. Life is short, and that's okay. It's important to have goals and achieve great things. But none of it matters if you lose your balance and stop appreciating what you have now. If you can't enjoy it now, what makes you think you'll enjoy it then?
6. Eat good food, drink plenty of water, and sleep as much as you need to. When loving others don't forget to love yourself too. Doing great things requires great rest and self-care.
7. What do you love? I loved my family and I never gave up. I loved computers and I never gave up. My skills came only after applying my mind over and over for years and that was possible because I loved what I did in some way.
8. Money and technology are just tools. Use them wisely. Things are just things. Enjoy them but don't get attached. It all goes away in the end. Prioritize relationships and experiences over objects.
9. Life is a wonderful and complex mystery. We know some, but we don't know much more. Embrace mystery and wonder and discovery and learning. Let the journey take you and please smell the roses along the way. Find beauty anywhere... in clouds or weeds or insects.
10. You might be tempted to hide your creations, ideas, feelings, and thoughts. Share them.
11. It's okay to be imperfect. Be perfectly imperfect.
12. Focus on what you can control. Search diligently every day for your gratitude. It is hidden in plain sight. When life happens be careful to label things "good" and "bad". Sometimes life is just happening. Labeling comes with consequences.
13. Pay attention to how you talk to yourself. Are you opening new possibilities or shutting them down? Are you coloring your experience in a negative light or a positive one? Be your own coach when nobody else is, before you become your own worst enemy.
14. Life is a repetition of challenges. Some choose to see blessings and curses. There is always something to learn. And if you are looking for lessons you will be doing well. Sometimes they aren't pleasant or easy to digest. But bitter medicine still makes us well.
15. Everyone is selling something. Even if it's just an outlook. Because it's not only misery that loves company. We all have views that are looking for reinforcement. Even the ones that separate and isolate us. It's a complex web of patterns battling for survival. Be mindful and assertive about what you allow into your mind and what you reject. Interrogate yourself with brutal honesty about whether you really desire something or if that idea was planted there by your parents or society or a corporation. Which leads me to...
16. Take advice with a grain of salt, even mine. There are good guides but we're all just doing the best we can, imperfectly as it may be... Form your own ideas and perspectives and try them out in the lab of experience.
17. We're all given some raw material to work with, but it's up to you to develop it and apply it.
18. Find out what really matters to you. Share it with as many people as you can.
19. If you are bored, get up and do something. Read a book. Visit the Internet. Travel. Write. Draw. Paint. Climb mountains. Take a nap. Explore a dream. Do the impossible. Help. Learn. Practice. Dance. Run. Discover. Rest.
20. You got this. I love you.
