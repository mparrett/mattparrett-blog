A confession...

I'm a notorious excuse maker, avoidance artist, and rationalizer. There's always a juicy way of avoiding responsibility waiting to be grabbed.

House a mess? -- Got a one year old. My plate's full. Doesn't matter, we don't get a lot of visitors. 

Bills aren't paid? -- Times are rough. Expenses up. Salary down. I shouldn't have to pay. 

Haven't been training? -- Back's been sore, wrist is sore, busy at home, busy at work. Jiu jitsu isn't life-or-death important, it can wait. 

The truth is, I always have a choice. I choose how to perceive and interpret whatever's going on at any time. I choose inaction or action. I choose my attitude. I choose to feel as if I don't have a choice.

I can always be too busy, overloaded, overworked, under-rested, over-stressed, too sore, misunderstood, too distracted, under-appreciated, etc.

... if I choose to be. 

Today I'm choosing to drop the distractions, face the facts, and do the work.
