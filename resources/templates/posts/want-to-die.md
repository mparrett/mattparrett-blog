I shuffle through the parking lot, secretly hoping he won't answer.

"Hello?"

"Uh, hi. I'm going through a weird thing. I just want to die."

Without skipping a beat, "It's okay, that's normal."

"Go somewhere quiet and write down everything you're thankful for."

I trusted him just enough to try this strange suggestion. I forced myself to make a list. Surprisingly, I felt better. I didn't get drunk that night and I didn't kill myself. 

After many similar experiences, I started figuring it out. Feel awful, like dying? Practice gratitude. Eventually it didn't require a crisis. I learned to be thankful during bad and good times. Now, I don't have to force it. The opportunity to be thankful is hidden in every moment. Gratitude is a gift that flows from my heart when I rest in the truth. 

Mom recently reminded me of my childhood morning battle cry: "Let the day begin!"

May we all appreciate the beauty and wonder of our lives as children do.
