4/13/2013

As the first third of 2013 comes to an end, one thing stands out. Right now I'm so full of gratitude for the life that was given to me, with all its ups and downs. 

I'm thankful for the friends, old and new. I'm thankful for immediate and extended family. For their radiant love and support. Selfless sacrifices. For all the mistakes, victories, tough love, opportunities to serve, life lessons, and surprising experiences. For health and illness. Just to name a few.

My Mom tells me when I was a child, I'd wake up and enthusiastically exclaim "Let the day begin!" I'm older now, and don't always start my day in a great mood. But the spirit of enthusiasm is back, and I'm so excited.

Thank you!
