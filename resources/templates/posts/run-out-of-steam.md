I tend to run out of steam after a couple months of doing anything of importance with consistency. Then I get this weird overwhelmed feeling. To short circuit that, I'm testing out "require only the bare minimum". Hopefully that'll help me overcome that initial barrier to action.

Instead of "I write 3 pages every morning" I'm going with "I write one sentence every morning".

"I do 50 push-ups every morning" becomes "I do one push-up every morning"

Sustainability is important.
