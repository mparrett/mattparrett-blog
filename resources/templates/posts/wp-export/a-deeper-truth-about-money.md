My mind just exploded with the force of a ten megaton nuke.

I thought I had money all figured out.

Intellectually, it's neither good nor bad. It's just a currency. It's about transaction. And it makes people act funny.

Beyond this intellectual acknowledgement, I still felt uneasy about money. Somewhere deep down, something wasn't right.

With this year's tax deadline approaching, I reached a breaking point. I was crumbling under the weight of my credit card debt and impending tax bill.

Then something changed.

I can't adequately explain how this happened, but I'll try. Feeling completely stuck, I meditated. I prayed. I let go entirely and then took action. Fear pushed me away. Desire drew me near. And somewhere between the two, a different path was illuminated. From this new perspective, I learned a lot about myself.

I was attached to money and stuff. Way more than I thought.

Despite my thinking about money, my beliefs were pretty rotten and confused at best.

I used to believe money was associated with greed, corruption, evil, and badness. I believed that some people do good things with money, but on the whole, it's a corrupting influence. Nobody can be financially successful without giving in to the temptation of evil corrupted behavior. On some level, I didn't want to be a part of that.

Was this actually true? What if it wasn't?

I felt inspired to do an experiment for a few days. Whenever I bought something, I would radiate feelings of gratitude from a detached place. Sometimes it just meant a heartfelt "thank you" under my breath. I'd focus on the value being received, and gladly show appreciation for whatever I was buying. Money became a currency of appreciation.

My old beliefs revolted.Â And during their revolt, they revealed themselves! Every time I bought something, I felt I was sacrificing a hard-earned limited resource for something that wasn't even worth the price. It was a strange feeling to witness this happening in my mind, but I remained calm. Eventually I experienced a radical perspective shift. All sorts of weird things started happening. My bank accounts were all in the red. Then I got a free limeade at Sonic. An unexpected check showed up. Some money got lost. Everything was okay.

I have a feeling this is only the tip of the iceberg. I do feel lighter and less worried about my finances. And I'm extremely excited to see what comes next.

I encourage you to challenge your own stance on money. It did wonders for me.
