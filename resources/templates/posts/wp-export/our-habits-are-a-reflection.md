Our habits speak volumes by reflecting our inner life. They can reveal to others what's important to us. They can signal us to change and grow.  Thankfully my habits have changed a lot over the years. I wasn't always aware of what my habits were reflecting about me. What are your habits reflecting about you?

In 2009, my habits included:

- Not eating an entire pizza in one sitting
- Drinking less than 10 beers a night
- Exercising in the small window between sobering up and getting drunk
- Always exercising hard without concern for my body
- Standing in the shower for 30 minutes praying for pain to stop
- Re-hydrating until hangover fades
- Taking sleeping pills and painkillers, staying as numb as possible
- Drinking as much caffeine as possible
- Taking acetaminophen sparingly to avoid liver damage
- Maintaining a spiritual void

I wasn't exactly flourishing, but things started changing in 2011. Divine providence mysteriously corrected my course. I had clarity and finally knew lasting recovery was around the bend.
Now in 2013, my habits reflect a different life.I'm joyfully married, my son Micah is nearly a year old, and I'm healthy. I'm successful in my career working for a Facebook gaming startup, I write, compete in jiu jitsu tournaments, and have plenty time and energy for my family. This is by far the happiest, healthiest, busiest, most productive, most challenging, and least stressed year of my life.

My new habits:

- Stay hydrated
- Get enough sunlight
- Get adequate sleep
- Read fiction before bed to relax
- Eat high quality food
- Take supplements and vitamins strategically
- Fast intermittently
- Stretch regularly
- Practice jiu jitsu regularly
- Meditate and pray every day
- Reflect and grow through introspection
- Eat occasional rice and pasta, beans, and sweet potatoes
- Avoid alcohol and sugar
- Be very careful with fruits (juicy sacs of sugar)
- Completely avoid bread, tortillas, or potatoes
- Eat healthy fats: Coconut oil, organic grass fed butter, and avocado/guacamole
- Avoid nuts but prefer high quality almonds
- Eat broccoli and spinach
- Eat grass fed beef, Free range chicken, Salmon
- Eat eggs and whey protein (30g shake every morning)
- Improve brain function by taking krill oil, magnesium, B-complex, D3, oxaloacetate, vinpocetine
- Cut myself some slack on the diet rules once a week (free day)
- Take activated charcoal on free days for damage control

Now I'm focused on learning, growing, doing the right things, and inspiring others. I'm truly blessed and so thankful for this adventurous life. I hope my habits reflect my gratitude.
