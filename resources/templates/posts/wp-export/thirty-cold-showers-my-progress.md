I decided to focus on CHOICE in 2014. And I just made ~~a stupid~~ an interesting one. My Facebook friends seem to agree:

> This sounds horrible -- Caleb

> I'm honestly hard pressed to think of anything that sounds worse. -- Drew

Except Kris. Somehow he independently made the same decision on the same day. Weird?

So here's the deal. Lately I've become a little soft. Staying in the warm shower avoiding the cold bedroom, refusing to leave the warm bed cocoon, etc. You know how this goes, right? It's freezing outside, for goodness sake.

Well, with two impressionable babies around, I won't set such an example. A quivering shivering Dad is not effective!

**So I'm committing to 30 days of cold showers.**

If you've become attached to your comfort zone, consider joining me! We can keep each other accountable.

I've been known to jump into a freezing pool every now and then. And I've done limited experiments with cold showers. But never 30 days straight with water this cold. Should be interesting. Honestly, I'm a little afraid the cold will kill me.

Originally, I was planning to post Facebook status updates of my progress. But I'm posting on the blog because a lot of friends were reasonably asking <strong>why would I do such a thing</strong>?

Much has been written about cold shower therapy, so check out the links at the bottom. I'm sure they can explain it better than I can. But suffice to say I want to boost my discipline, break out of my comfort zone, and kick procrastination in the nuts.

Rules for the next 30 days:

- One shower per day, minimum 5 minutes.
- All showers are cold -- no warm showers until 2/9/14<
- Shower as early as possible for maximum impact.
- Write about the experience.

## Day 1: ##

I just finished the first. It was pretty cold, but would have been colder if I started this morning when the water temp was just above freezing. It warms up quick here in AZ, so by the end it was a balmy ~65F. Thankfully I plunged in right away and got blasted with some of the freezing stuff before it was gone.

The cold gave me tunnel vision and took my breath right away. But I quickly regained control of my breathing and remained conscious. After 30 seconds I was focused and alert. Soap didn't seem to work as well. Felt like scrubbing a frozen mannequin wrapped in goose-bumpy chicken skin.

It was tempting to avoid the brunt of the water. But when I caught myself doing this, I'd just move back in. Once my resistance dropped, it was pretty invigorating. Looking forward to the next one.

## Day 2: ##

On the whole, less satisfying than day 1. And by satisfying, I mean miserable. Not the level of challenge and development I'm aiming for. I want to be carved of wood, not cookie dough.

Unfortunately I procrastinated until the water was in the 60's. I also failed to notice my wife set the temperature back to what a normal human being would use, so my initial cold shock was interrupted by a lukewarm transition. I barely lost my breath this time. However, I didn't hesitate to switch it back to cold. Still, the unexpected lukewarm comfort killed the mood.

Tomorrow, I'll start earlier when the water's still painfully frigid and double check the temp setting.

Despite all the setbacks, I practiced slowing down and washing more thoroughly, in spite of the cold pressuring me to exit as quickly as possible. Still a good day. Tomorrow should be more spectacular.

## Day 3: ##

Yesterday's shower was unimpressive. Despite starting first thing in the morning, the water was still in the low to mid 60's and I was interrupted halfway through by my son waking up. I stayed in for the full five minutes but did not wash as thoroughly as day 2.

Today I'm going to try the guest bathroom. It has a terrible shower nozzle that sprays a fine mist. Even with hot water, it feels cold. Do you think this is perceptual or does the water actually cool significantly as it travels through the air?

I seemed to procrastinate less yesterday. Was my increased productivity just due to a placebo effect? In any case, it was nice. I didn't feel the mental drain of not doing stuff. I just did the stuff that needed to be done. I'm curious if that effect will continue.

That's all for day 3. Stay tuned!

## Day 4: ##

I took my cold shower in the guest bathroom as planned. This shower has the most pitiful nozzle. It sprays a fine cooled mist. I simultaneously applaud and regret my decision. Nothing very remarkable to report.

## Day 5: ##

I procrastinated all day and there's 15 minutes left until midnight. It's dark, babies are asleep, and I'd love to crawl into bed. Taking a cold shower sounds awful. But I won't bail on my commitment. Resistance built all day and the spray is a cold slap to the face.

Most offensive shower so far. I could be resting and I'm chilling in the shower.

It takes me a little while longer to catch my breath, and my mind is already starting a pity party. Why did I do this? How many more days to go? Bah! I decided to challenge myself. This is good. I'm getting stronger. Soon, I'm feeling invigorated and refreshed. When I get out, I'm welcomed by a room temperature towel that feels like heaven. Somehow I'm looking forward to doing this again tomorrow.

I'm still not shivering though. Someone said something about an ice bath. Hmm...

## UPDATE Day 6: ##

Waited until the last minute again. The shower was unremarkable, especially after swimming several laps in a 42F pool earlier that day.

The pool? Definitely the coldest water I've ever been submerged in. Really shocking, actually. Takes your breath away and leaves you feeling very tingly, numb, and oddly warm sensations for many minutes after taking a dip. I've been afraid of the cold as long as I can remember, so today's spontaneous swim was awesomely rewarding.

## UPDATE Day 7: ##

Another boring shower. I did find a way to get slightly colder water by restricting the water flow. Maybe there's some unintentional hot water mixing happening. But even with this tweak, the shower was only mildly unpleasant with a few seconds of disrupted breathing.

## Day 8 ##

The shower today seemed brutally cold. It took me twice as long as normal to catch my breath, and my mind was fighting me until the last 30 seconds or so. The soap doesn't lather at all. Interestingly, after the shower the bathroom was filled with a pleasant warmish moisture. Cara thinks this was my soul escaping my body, seeking a bit of warmth. That's all I got.

## Day 9 ##

Today is was pretty cold. The faucet measured 57F this morning. During the shower, I noticed a few things: First, I prepared mentally much more than I did for previous showers. Second, the water seemed only mildly chilled. So I fiddled with the pressure knob and got blasted with shiver-inducing spray. This caused me to lean forward, getting bitter cold shampoo water in my right eye. The only response was to laugh. Aside from that, I noticed my breathing was pretty erratic. I'm going to focus on staying calm instead of frenetically cleaning myself as a distraction.

## Day 11 ##

My efforts to kick procrastination in the nuts continue. Today I didn't waste time and took a shower immediately after my standard morning ritual of 16 ounces of cold water. The shower was pretty cold, and I had to reset my breathing on a few occasions. It was challenging to refocus- goose bumps would lead to shivering, would lead to tensing up. But great practice. Enjoyed the shower quite a bit today.

My friend <a href="https://www.facebook.com/francoise.rietbroek" target="_blank">Francoise</a> thinks I should extend the challenge to 90 days. If we're doing this one day at a time, what's an extra 60 days? Just yesterday I was thinking of reducing my 90 day fitness challenge to 30, before I officially announced it on Facebook. But now I'm not sure I can wiggle out that easy.

90 days? Challenge ACCEPTED!

## Day 12 ##

My mind definitely went in a different direction today. Knowing I had 89 more days to go, I thought, could I learn to like these (currently miserable) cold showers? What if I dropped all resistance and embraced them, to the best of my ability?

So I tried that. I also, for some reason, turned the lights off for an added challenge. Would it be easier or harder to focus in near complete darkness?

After my eyes acclimated to the low light conditions, I jumped in. My mind was slightly more focused. This time, something seemed subtly different. I felt the water in more detail. I felt cold and warm patches of my skin. I wasn't fighting as much. Am I making peace with my new cold-water situation?

Afterward, I was pleasantly surprised. My soreness from the last 3 days of working out (I committed to 90 days of healthier eating and exercise) had dissipated significantly. Which was great, because I was hobbling before. So many squats! That's all for today.

## Day 13 ##

Another cold shower. What's left to say? It is what it is. Some people don't have the privilege of taking a cold or warm shower. So I mainly feel gratitude today. It was somewhat refreshing after the box jumps from day 5 of the fitness experiment.

My skin's getting pretty dry. My lips are chapped and my knuckles are cracking. I rarely have this problem so I wonder if it's the daily cold chlorine rinse.

## Days 14 and 15 ##

I procrastinated hard yesterday. Once the babies finally went to bed, so did I. Sometime around 3am I realized my mistake. But it wasn't until after 8 that I started making up lost ground.

The two showers I took today were cold and mostly uninteresting. The same terrible barely lathering soap and misty low pressure spray. I noticed my breathing was a lot more controlled today.

Then I took another freezing pool dip. I timed it this time, just over a minute was all I could stand at 51F. Painful, but less shocking than my previous 42F attempt.

Maybe these extra sessions of cold will help counteract the extreme DOMS coming my way from today's fitness challenge which included 250 sumo dead lift high pulls, 62 squats, and 112 sit ups.

## Day 16 ##

Felt like a normal cold shower. Or I'm getting lazy with these updates. Taking more discipline to journal than it is to shower.

## Day 17 ##

This is the point in the challenge where I'd usually be feeling some relief. Just a downhill coast from here. But! By some miracle, I'm in this one for 90. And my only choice is to take it head on, one day at a time. Well, there is one other choice: Quit. Not for me. I'm committed to this wacky experiment.

Tonight, the thing I love most about this cold shower experiment became clear. Every day, I get five minutes to remember who I am. On the 17th day, am I loving it or hating it? Can I smile with cold water blasting me in the face? You bet I can.

When life squirts you in the eyes with lemons, be thankful you have eyes.

## Days 18-19 ##

Two more days of cold showers. Yesterday, I put it off until the evening. Today I got it done in the morning. And there seems to be a noticeable positive difference in how I am approaching challenges today. But I'm doubtful the early shower is the cause. They are more likely an external indicator of my attitude.

So that leaves me with the question, if it feels better to do what's important without hesitating, why have I ever procrastinated? Why does it seem so tempting at times?

Perhaps I've practiced procrastination for so long, it's just a deep habit. But I'm learning about a whole new reality, where you just do what you need to do without distracting yourself and ruminating until the last possible moment. At the very least, it's interesting.

## Days 20-22 ##

The last few days have been a little blah. My immune system finally gave way to some infection that's been going around from family member to family member. The showers are still cold. My focus still wavers. Waiting for some consistency in attitude, but perhaps there is none to be found. Or maybe I have to create it.

I wrote about the rest of the challenge here:
