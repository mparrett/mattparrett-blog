As I write more, I am starting to appreciate its power. Something almost magical happens when I transform the unspoken into written words. My relationship with my thoughts and ideas suddenly changes. The vague apparitions once confined to my subconscious are forced out into the open, unable to hide. They're encoded, transmitted, and decoded, arriving at all corners of the earth.

Today I'd like to release some unspoken thoughts. I want them to become tangible so they can visit you, wherever you are.

**Thank you for being who you are.**

You are truly amazing.Â You do great things and together we do even better.

United and connected, our technology extends, enhances, and empowers us. Where it stands strong, we gladly heap our burdens upon its back. Where it is fragile, we nurture and protect it. It helps us overcome limitations and introduces us to new ones. As it changes our world, we learn, teach, and grow, investing strongly and confidently in the future.

We choose to solve hard problems because we understand the importance of the solutions. Through these challenges, we yearn to know more about ourselves and what we're capable of. We pour our hearts, minds, and souls into everything we do, and we must allow ourselves time to breathe and have fun.

We are interactive, alive, and have a tremendous capacity to love. Our boundaries and barriers are phantoms that crumble under the force of true awareness. Hiding patiently in plain sight, our true nature anticipates our embrace.

We are the adventurers, explorers, thinkers, tinkerers, creators, builders, warriors and helpers. Our imaginations are rich and boundless. We seek inspiration wherever we might find it and hope guides us through uncertain times.

Where others say "impossible" we say "we will find a way".
