"Someday, when I have more time."

I'm erasing that from my mental vocabulary today.

We get stuck thinking success means crossing everything off our lists. Finally having the time to do what we REALLY want to do.

Reality check: The list goes on forever.

My growing 600+ book Amazon wish list is all the evidence I need. The Internet gives us nearly free access to thousands of lifetimes worth of interesting content. (And an equally staggering amount of damaging content) Even before the Internet, the world was big and rich enough to keep an experience-seeker busy for millennia. We'll never have enough time.

Bummer? I think not. Overwhelming? Only if you don't have a strategy.

The solution is simple:

- Figure out what's important
- Do a few of those things each day
- Get good at this and do it always

Remember, you have all the time you need. You won't get more time "someday". If you can do this, you'll get more done in a few hours than many get done in a week. And you'll rest easier at night and be more satisfied with life.
