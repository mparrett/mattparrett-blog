<strong>I have a lot to learn about losing.</strong>

I competed in a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu tournament this past weekend in Phoenix.  It was my first tournament as a featherweight blue belt.

I barely made weight. Then, I lost two matches. I felt pretty good about my performance but eventually my inner feelings got the best of me. Once the adrenaline wore off, I started feeling awful. I didn't win a single match. But I took 3rd place and technically had earned a bronze medal.

As I approached the podium, feeling completely let down and undeserving, I took a jab at myself:

<em>"I'm here for the bronze medal I 'earned' by losing two matches in a row"</em>

Was I really that undeserving?

It was as if I had totally forgotten the commendable performance, all the tough training, <a title="My healthy habits: then and now" href="http://mattparrett.com/2013/03/how-i-stay-happy-and-healthy/">dieting</a>, stress management, mental backflips, and personal sacrifice that got me there.

One match was lost by ref's decision. The other didn't go my way by a single advantage. Very close to say the least! My coach even congratulated me on a great performance. I made some mistakes but overall I was more aware, focused, and confident than ever. I had a lot to be thankful for.  My opponents were just good at jiu jitsu and better prepared. As a result, I lost my matches.

I lost perspective because I didn't have the right mindset when the negative thoughts started creeping in. This sudden negativity phenomenon might arise from exhaustion and depletion of neurotransmitters. Whatever the cause, it helps to recognize those fleeting thoughts and feelings as what they are -- just thoughts and feelings. You aren't your <a title="You Aren’t What You Think" href="http://mattparrett.com/2013/06/you-arent-what-you-think/">thoughts</a>. You aren't your wins/loss ratio. You aren't your belt level.

We may not have complete control over the outcome, but we can focus on performing well and handling losses with grace.
