Hi, I'm Matt.

I'm a 31-year old father, husband, adventurer, and lifelong learner.

My interests are pretty eclectic, ranging from foreign language and culture to Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. I've been programming since I was 11.

<strong>Some highlights...</strong>

2006- I quit my call center job to pursue a career in programming.
2008- I began training Brazilian Jiu Jitsu with <a href="http://gdjiujitsu.com">Gustavo Dantas</a>.
2009- I achieved a childhood dream of <a href="http://brokenbulbstudios.com">programming computer games</a>.
2010- I <strong><a href="http://www.facebook.com/MonasticChallenge">quit meat, alcohol, sugar</a></strong>, and sex for a month
2011- My beautiful wife Rachael said "Yes"!
2012- My first son Micah was born in April.

This blog is an evolving experiment in sharing my life, interests, and insights.

New adventures are always in progress, so <strong>stay tuned</strong> for updates.

Thank you for stopping by!
