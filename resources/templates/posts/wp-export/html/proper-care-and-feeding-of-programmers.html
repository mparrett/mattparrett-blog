<p>I'm investing some time this weekend to brush up on my skills and I've got programming on my mind. Managers and programmers both can benefit by understanding some basic truths about programming.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some recommendations for managers and programmers:</p>
<p dir="ltr">1. Programming is an intense mental activity - we do hard work. This work is hard to understand if you've not done it before. We are constantly thinking about our work. Code dances in our minds as we dream. Unsolved problems haunt us around the clock. Respect how challenging it can be and do what you can to reduce distractions and <strong>protect the sanctity of focused and concentrated effort</strong>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">2. Often times, managers think more hours or "harder work" will produce a better product. We better think again. There's a good chance your programmers are overworked. <strong>Force them to go home an hour early</strong> or take Friday off and see if they produce better code in less time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">3. Sometimes we think having more resources will help improve output. Maybe a bigger team would help. Maybe if the team worked in a different way we could get better code in less time. Maybe bonuses or monetary incentives would drive more creative solutions. Probably not. Try taking pressure off your programmers. <strong>Reward creativity and smart solutions rather than extra hours and pure brute effort.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">4. Programmers often feel trapped by boring and monotonous assignments, especially on long projects. While they're working on these responsibilities, their minds are teeming with creative ideas just waiting to be expressed. If there's no outlet, this extra activity can stifle their efforts on whatever's been assigned to them. <strong>Give them some freedom</strong>Â and guilt-free time away from normal duties. Or if you're a programmer, ask for it. Seriously, don't be afraid. You'll be pleasantly surprised how this positively impacts productivity and work quality.</p>
