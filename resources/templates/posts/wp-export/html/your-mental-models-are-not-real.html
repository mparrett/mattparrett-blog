<p dir="ltr">Our minds model reality. Do you know which mental models you use? Are they serving you or holding you back? Could you learn new ones to look at problems in new ways?</p>
<p dir="ltr">When I was a kid, I built and painted model airplanes and cars. I loved being able to hold a fighter jet or sports car in my hand. I could interact with it and see how all the parts related. Like a drawing or photo, but useful in different ways.</p>
Our minds use mental models to help us make sense of a complicated reality. We all have default models, but we can learn new ones. We just need to be willing to slow down and see things differently. They're usually efficient an inaccurate. And they work well enough. Usually.

You might view your finances with a "bucket" model. If you don't, here's your chance! Your paycheck fills the bucket. Your expenses drain it. A random emergency is water splashing over the side. And in this model, we all want our buckets to be overflowing. More on that later!

This helpful model doesn't tell you much about hidden bank fees, interest rates, compound interest, and so on. There are different and more complicated models for those things. You'd be paralyzed if you had to analyze all the intricacies and details every time you made a decision.

Models are great, but they have problems. Sometimes we confuse the model with reality. We become enthralled and obsessed and with a model, losing sight of reality. Models are just approximations and we'd be seriously limited if we only thought about our bank accounts as buckets. The models are not real. Don't confuse the model for reality.
