Out of my <a title="Thirty Cold Showers – My Progress" href="http://mattparrett.com/2014/01/thirty-cold-showers-my-progress/" target="_blank">cold shower therapy challenge</a> came a spontaneous desire to eat better, exercise, and generally take better care of myself.

I'm going to exercise every day (except for planned rest days) for 90 days and see what happens. Will I have more energy? Will my mood improve?

I'll also be "eating clean" by adhering as closely as possible (without obsessing) to the Perfect Health Diet.

I've committed to 90 days of "healthier living". What does that mean exactly?

The underlying idea is consistent progress, not some to create another crazy and complicated extreme challenge that demands perfection. Simplicity. What do you think?

Right now it means making more good decisions. Eating better, exercising, sleeping more. I'm still figuring out the details, but so far I think it'll look something like this:
<ul>
	<li>Every day, exercise at least 15 minutes. Whatever you can do. Rest days when appropriate.</li>
	<li>Adhere 80% to the guidelines in the Perfect Health Diet book. Especially, cut out sugar as much as possible. Maybe indulge once or twice a week.</li>
	<li>Sleep when you feel tired instead of pushing through with caffeine.</li>
</ul>
<strong>
UPDATE Days 1-4:</strong>

Completed all planned exercises. Rested on day 4, did some light yoga/stretching. Feeling pretty energized. Also noticed some new muscle definition.

<strong>UPDATE Days 5-8:</strong>

Completed all planned exercises, added an additional rest day, postponing the first 3 mile run. Feeling sooooore.

<strong>Day 6 Details:</strong>

Warning, potentially boring training journal ahead:

Today, according to my written plan, I attempted as many rounds as possible of the following in 20 minutes after a warm-up:

(5 Pull-ups, 15 squats, 10 push-ups)

I was a bit intimidated, especially by the pull-ups. I've not done more than 5 in a long time. The guide said I could substitute sit-ups, but I really wanted to try these first. I reviewed my motives, remembered how I feel after successfully finishing a workout, and got started preparing my improvised backyard gym.

My first attempt at a warm-up pull-up failed. I could see my reflection in the back door. My body jerked left and right trying to compensate for an overall lack of strength and coordination. I tried focusing and visualizing perfect form. No help, not happening.

I remembered you can use elastic bands to assist with pull-ups. I had a red one lying around that I never used, so I strung it up and hooked my foot in. It didn't provide much assistance, maybe 10 pounds, but I was able to slowly do 2 pull-ups with much better form. Challenge on!

I started immediately, finishing 6 full rounds with about 2 minutes to spare. I completed 1 pull-up in the last set, but couldn't get the second. I decided to complete the other part of the set (push-ups and squats) and come back to try try the remaining 4 pull-ups. I got one more pull-up, but that was it. 30 seconds left, and the workout was done.

In total:

* 118 squats
* 82 push-ups
* 34 pull-ups

I think that's more than I did all last year. In 20 minutes. On one day. I feel pretty good about this.

* Yup, that's the new name of this experiment. Cheesy, but I like it. And thanks again for keeping me accountable. I feel more tempted to quit this challenge than the cold showers.
