I confess, I've made a lot of excuses for myself and others.

I'm a notorious excuse maker and rationalizer.

There's always a juicy way of <strong>avoiding responsibility</strong> waiting for me to grab. But it's never truthful.
<ul>
	<li>House a mess? -- Got a one year old. My plate's full. Doesn't matter, we don't get a lot of visitors.</li>
	<li>Bills aren't paid? -- Times are rough. Expenses up. Salary down. I shouldn't have to pay.</li>
	<li>Haven't been training? -- Back's been sore, wrist is sore, busy at home, busy at work. Jiu jitsu isn't life-or-death important, it can wait.</li>
</ul>
The truth is, I always have a choice. I choose how to perceive and interpret whatever's going on at any time. I choose inaction or action and I choose my attitude.

<strong>I even choose to feel like I don't have a choice.</strong>

I can always be too busy, overloaded, overworked, under-rested, over-stressed, too sore, misunderstood, too distracted, under-appreciated, etc.

... if I choose to be.

Today I'm choosing to drop the excuses and distractions, face the facts, and <a title="Old Habits Die Easy" href="http://mattparrett.com/2013/06/old-habits-die-easy/">do the work</a>.
