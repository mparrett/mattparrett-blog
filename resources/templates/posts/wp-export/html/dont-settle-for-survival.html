If you're reading this, you are a survivor. Are you just surviving?

<strong>I have to admit I can be obsessed with survival.</strong> Something draws me to it -- the gear, the outdoors, the triumph over natural adversity. <a href="http://www.beargrylls.com/">Bear Grylls</a> and <a href="http://lesstroud.ca/bio">Les Stroud</a> are cool dudes. I don't care if Man vs Wild is staged and yes, Survivorman is a better show. My Dad was awarded a purple heart after surviving a booby-trap blast in Vietnam. Maybe I inherited some of my survivalist tendencies from my father. He's a tough dude. But there's a problem with survival obsession. It's easy to get stuck  in survival mode in life.

Survival alone can be kind of a dark place.

<strong>Once, I was a kid who had lots of fun.</strong> I drank mountain dew and ate pizza and played video games. Then I grew up and got into trouble. I've survived many inglorious misadventures and <a href="http://mattparrett.com/2013/03/how-i-stay-happy-and-healthy/">bad life choices</a>, narrowly avoiding death on several occasions. I always felt pretty lucky. It took me years to move beyond just surviving. Sometimes I felt content because I had survived so many harrowing adventures. It was enough (and comfortable) to just be alive.  But watching my own son grow up has changed my perspective. The importance of living beyond survival is very clear now.

We are all born with a deep calling to greatness that extends far beyond mere survival. Survival is a necessary starting point, but we shouldn't get trapped there. Once you're surviving, start planning your adventures. Then boldly take action.

"We are all meant to shine, as children do." -- <a href="http://www.marianne.com/">Marianne Williamson</a>

I find that moving beyond survival can be accomplished with a few simple habits.
<ul>
	<li>Live fully in the present. Release the anchors of the past. Slow down.</li>
	<li>Be continuously grateful. You may not feel it, but it's there. Be patient.</li>
	<li>Know things will be just fine. All it takes is a glimmer of hope. Wait for it.</li>
</ul>
I give this advice to myself as much as to you:

Don't settle for <strong>just surviving</strong>. It's time to shine!
