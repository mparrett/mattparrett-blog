I've been <a href="http://hrostoski.com/2012/04/im-thinking-about-doing-something/">thinking about</a> <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2006/01/how-to-build-a-high-traffic-web-site-or-blog/">starting a blog</a> for about 6 years. During that time, I avoiding taking action and can cite countless excuses. I stayed blissfully inert, enjoying the comfort of <a title="Don’t settle for survival" href="http://mattparrett.com/2013/03/dont-settle-for-survival/">survival mode</a>, maintaining the status quo, and deftly avoiding or denying scary things. I've been truly terrified to put myself out there.

My fear kept me from <strong>finding my voice</strong> and sharing my life. Being vulnerable scares me. I could fail and be harshly criticized. I could be rejected. My potential success is even frightening. 

Today, I'm still afraid but there is a difference. Fear is my signal to act, my opportunity indicator. <a href="http://mattparrett.com/2013/03/how-to-lose-a-brazilian-jiu-jitsu-tournament/" title="How to Lose a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Tournament">Jiu jitsu competitions</a> taught me that <strong>champions act courageously in the face of fear</strong>. Fear will no longer beat me down every day. I'm "<a href="http://www.stevenpressfield.com/turning-pro/">turning pro</a>". I'm launching this blog and journeying into the unknown.

I'm glad you stopped by. Welcome to the adventure.
