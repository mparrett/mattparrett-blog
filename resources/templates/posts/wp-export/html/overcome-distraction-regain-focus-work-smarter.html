I'm a <a title="About" href="http://mattparrett.com/about/">busy person</a> and wanted to make the most of my time studying this gem. I made time to take notes and looked at the material from as many angles as possible.

First, I listened to the the audio book in my car. Then I read and copied the practical advice from Kindle. Finally, I revised and compiled the list below. I'm left with a nice (albeit oversimplified) reminder of the practical advice.
<h4>About thinking...</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Thought is a <strong>precious resource</strong>- conserve and <strong>allocate wisely</strong>.</li>
	<li>First, identify what is important. (<strong>Prioritize prioritizing</strong>)</li>

	<li><strong>Schedule demanding tasks</strong> for when you are fresh.</li>
	<li>Schedule blocks of time for specific modes of thinking.</li>
