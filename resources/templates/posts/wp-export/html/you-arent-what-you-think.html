Today started like any other. Woke up at 5am. Drank a cold glass of water and started brewing some <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiJeZYY2wiA" target="_blank">Bulletproof Coffee</a>. Carefully navigating a minefield of baby toys, I caught myself saying:

"I don't feel like doing this today. Isn't it time for a break?"

I've been <a title="Old Habits Die Easy" href="http://mattparrett.com/2013/06/old-habits-die-easy/" target="_blank">building a new habit</a> for 20 days now: writing, stretching, and exercising <strong>every morning</strong>.

So I started my morning routine, struggling with every page of my writing. Then, beginning my exercise, I heard:

"It's time for a break from this discipline stuff. What do you think this is, the military?"

Ha, that's a new one!

This voice of limitation speaks to us when we attempt anything of value. Steven Pressfield calls it <a href="http://www.stevenpressfield.com/2013/06/resistance-comes-second/" target="_blank">Resistance</a>. You may want to read his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1936891026/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1936891026&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=mattparcom-20">The War of Art</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mattparcom-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1936891026" width="1" height="1" border="0" />, by the way. It's great.

Give this voice a chance and it'll tell you all sorts of things. It may even sound like your own voice! No wonder we spend so much time <span style="text-decoration: underline;">believing we are what we think</span>. After years of practice with limiting thoughts, I'm still amused by their cunning and determination. But they must underestimate my commitment to this battle. I'm not willing to throw in the towel and invite chaos and destruction back into my life. They did enough damage. Your limiting voice may speak to you differently, but I'm convinced they share notes!

<strong>Do any of these sound familiar?</strong>
<ul>
	<li>"I don't feel like it today / I deserve a rest"</li>
	<li>"This isn't really important / There are more important things to do"</li>
	<li>"You can skip it just this once / You can cheat just once"</li>
	<li>"This is a waste of time"</li>
</ul>
How can we turn this seemingly negative phenomenon into something helpful?

We use it as a signal or trigger for positive action. To start, there's <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no need to oppose</span> this inner critic, because it will just debate endlessly. Even if it can't win the argument, it will be pleased to have stolen some time. So simply work on noticing it without opposition. We start to sense, with practice, that our actions don't have to be dictated by our thoughts. Our choices are bigger than any momentary thinking might tell us. You might try using a simple label to keep these thoughts in their place. Calmly say to yourself "Thought" or "Thanks. Just a thought." Get good at noticing thoughts and you can start developing persistence by taking positive action in the face of negative limiting thinking.

Staying committed and moving forward despite mental (or physical) obstacles strengthens us. We may practice hundreds or thousands of times before it becomes automatic. Even when it's automatic, remain ever vigilant, as unique challenges and obstacles will arise. This battle may be very pragmatic for you, or a deeply spiritual one. Regardless, the enemy is crafty and is just as committed as we are. But remember, we have awareness, and we have the upper hand.

So next time you think you have a perfect reason to quit that project, stop experimenting with something new, or give up on the healthy eating, remember <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you aren't what you think</span>.
