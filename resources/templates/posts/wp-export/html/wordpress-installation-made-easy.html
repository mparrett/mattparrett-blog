My first WordPress installation in 2006 was a nightmare. I tried to <a title="I’m Terrified of Starting a Blog" href="http://mattparrett.com/2013/03/introducing-my-blog/" target="_blank">start a blog</a> but it was too slow for my short attention span. The code was strange. From that moment, I never gave WordPress a fair chance.
<h3>How I Stopped Hating WordPress</h3>
When I started this blog, I was face to face with my past nightmare. I asked a friend for some WordPress tips and he recommended <a href="http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=394686&amp;u=756706&amp;m=41388&amp;urllink=&amp;afftrack=">WP Engine</a> for hosting. Reluctantly, I signed up for a 60 day risk free trial.

"Wow" is the best way to describe my experience. Proper hosting makes a huge difference.

I have fallen in love with WordPress. The hosting is fast, simple, and affordable. It has already saved me money and countless headaches. The bells and whistles are cool too and it's only $29/month. If you're having WordPress problems, give it a try.
