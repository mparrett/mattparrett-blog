Here's a simple checklist you can use to keep yourself progressing toward your goals.
<h3><strong style="color: #666666; font-family: Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 25px;">1. Do you know your goal?</strong></h3>
Serious success requires serious vision. If we can't see success our mind, we are adrift at sea. We must first know our destination before plotting a course. Throw limitations overboard and let your imagination work. Let go of "if only" and "but" for a moment. Pretend you have succeeded. What does it look like? How do you feel? What are the implications? Take more time than you feel necessary as this is critical.
<p dir="ltr"><strong>2. Do you know why this goal is important?</strong></p>
Could you sell someone on taking this journey with you, or at least gain their support? Reflect on this until you can effortlessly explain why you're setting sail. Is this about improvement, exploration, fun, or something else? If your answer is somewhat cloudy like "I want to improve myself", allow yourself more time. How will your life improve when you succeed? How will it affect others? What doors will it open? Get detailed!
<p dir="ltr"><strong>3. Are you married to this goal or just dating it?</strong></p>
Major goals demand major commitment. Lack of commitment is one of the primary reasons we fail at changing deeply ingrained habits. Commitment is being willing to do whatever it takes to get the job done. We're in this for the long haul, we're ready to do all the work, and we see the big picture. We're willing to be wrong and fail, and we'll humbly seek help anywhere we can. We're sticking to the plan no matter what. We are accountable to ourselves and others. Commitment is our backbone and enables us to persist for the whole journey, which may be a lifetime.
<p dir="ltr"><strong>4. Are you accountable?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">We are notorious for changing the rules of the games we create. When the going gets tough, there are many ways to sneak out of our plans. We'll tell ourselves we were never committed in the first place, that circumstances have changed, that it's not really important anymore or was never important to begin with. Commit both to the goal and to being accountable to yourself and others. Seek techniques to hold yourself accountable and find groups that will support you. You'll need tough love if the goal is important. Good help is out there. Put in the work ahead of time to find the right support structures.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>5. Are you prepared?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Being unprepared will sink us before we leave the harbor. Thankfully, we're connected globally and all the information is at our fingertips. Put together a solid plan that works. Make sure you've made arrangements, have the necessary supplies, backup plans, organization, and whatever else you might need. Fortune favors the prepared!</p>
<p dir="ltr">Assess your progress regularly and be honest and objective. Run through the checklist again and remember, changing habits takes time and sustained effort. Keep a vision of success in your mind and take it one step at a time. Track your progress.</p>
<p dir="ltr"></p>
<p dir="ltr">Use this checklist daily or weekly. Go do great things!
