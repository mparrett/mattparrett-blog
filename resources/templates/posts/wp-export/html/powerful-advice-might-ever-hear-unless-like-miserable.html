Byron Katie said this:

<em>"As long as you think that the cause of your problem is 'out there'—as long as you think that anyone or anything is responsible for your suffering—the situation is hopeless."</em>

Wait, stay! I know, it's another quote. And I post a lot of quotes. But I really want you to consider what this one might mean for you. For me, it means a lot.
<ul>
	<li>It means taking ultimate responsibility for my attitude and how I conduct myself.</li>
	<li>It means learning, setting, and respecting boundaries, i.e. where I end and where others begin.</li>
	<li>And it means leaving God's business to God.</li>
</ul>
If you're like me, you probably still get attached to the idea that problems are "out there". That terrible things happen in the world and your negative feelings and suffering are justified.

For every thing seemingly "out there", there's something "in here" called "how we relate to the thing 'out there'". Which do we have more control over?

That's okay. I don't want you to change your mind because of me. But next time you're really stuck and want out of the pain, I want you to think about this possibility and see if it's true for you:

<em>Could there be something wrong "in here" instead of "out there"?</em>

Good luck, friends!
