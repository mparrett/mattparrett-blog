<strong>Counterfactual simulation</strong> is a simple and effective <a title="Business Development Strategy" href="http://mattparrett.com/category/business-development/" target="_blank">business development strategy</a> that requires only your brain. It costs nothing and gives you a new perspective on any problem you might be stuck with.

Start by asking a "what if" question, then generate ideas and capture the answers.

For example, I was recently stuck finding new ways to breathe new life into my business. So I asked myself about the <a title="Imagine the Opposite" href="http://mattparrett.com/2013/03/imagine-the-opposite/">opposite</a>. I brainstormed quietly for a few minutes and generated a list of answers.
<h3>If I was destroying my business, I would...</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Ignore customers</li>
	<li>Operate without clear values</li>
	<li>Perpetuate a mindset of fear and scarcity</li>
	<li>Don't deliver what you promise</li>
	<li>Provide minimum value for maximum price (overoptimization)</li>
	<li>Allow interacting with the business to become dissatisfying, frustrating, or boring</li>
	<li>Sacrifice long-term success for short term gain</li>
	<li>Avoid change and innovation</li>
	<li>Stay busy, productive, and distracted</li>
	<li>Create a poor quality product or service</li>
	<li>Don't generate excitement about your offering</li>
	<li>Make it difficult to purchase</li>
</ol>
Once I had this list, I used it to honestly assess where I might be harming my business. I'm seriously guilty of a few, and the others serve as signposts to direct me toward the things I should be doing, even if they aren't clear.

Look at tough business problems from a "counterfactual" position to gain valuable insights. Once you identify the problem, start working on a solution. Stop doing things that destroy your business and you will<a title="Consulting" href="http://mattparrett.com/consulting/"> <strong>succeed with less effort</strong></a>. Now go and do awesome!
