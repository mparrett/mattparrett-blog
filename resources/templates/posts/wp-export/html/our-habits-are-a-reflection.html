Our habits speak volumes by reflecting our inner life. They can reveal to others what's important to us. They can signal us to change and grow.  Thankfully my <a href="http://mattparrett.com/2013/06/old-habits-die-easy/" title="Old Habits Die Easy">habits have changed</a> a lot over the years. I wasn't always aware of what my habits were reflecting about me. What are your habits reflecting about you?

In 2009, my habits included:
<ul>
	<li>Not eating an entire pizza in one sitting</li>
	<li>Drinking less than 10 beers a night</li>
	<li>Exercising in the small window between sobering up and getting drunk</li>
	<li>Always exercising hard without concern for my body</li>
	<li>Standing in the shower for 30 minutes praying for pain to stop</li>
	<li>Re-hydrating until hangover fades</li>
	<li>Taking sleeping pills and painkillers, staying as numb as possible</li>
	<li>Drinking as much caffeine as possible</li>
	<li>Taking acetaminophen sparingly to avoid liver damage</li>
	<li>Maintaining a spiritual void</li>
</ul>
I wasn't exactly flourishing, but things started changing in <strong>2011</strong>. Divine providence mysteriously corrected my course. I had clarity and finally knew lasting recovery was around the bend.
Now in 2013, my habits reflect a different life.I'm joyfully married, my son Micah is nearly a year old, and I'm healthy. I'm successful in my career working for a Facebook gaming startup, I write, compete in jiu jitsu tournaments, and have plenty time and energy for my family. This is by far the happiest, healthiest, busiest, most productive, most challenging, and <strong style="font-size: 13px;">least stressed year of my life.</strong>

<strong>My new habits:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Stay hydrated</li>
	<li>Get enough sunlight</li>
	<li>Get adequate sleep</li>
	<li>Read fiction before bed to relax</li>
	<li>Eat high quality food</li>
	<li>Take supplements and vitamins strategically</li>
	<li>Fast intermittently</li>
	<li>Stretch regularly</li>
	<li>Practice jiu jitsu regularly</li>
	<li>Meditate and pray every day</li>
	<li>Reflect and grow through introspection</li>
	<li>Eat occasional rice and pasta, beans, and sweet potatoes</li>
	<li>Avoid alcohol and sugar</li>
	<li>Be very careful with fruits (juicy sacs of sugar)</li>
	<li>Completely avoid bread, tortillas, or potatoes</li>
	<li>Eat healthy fats: Coconut oil, organic grass fed butter, and avocado/guacamole</li>
	<li>Avoid nuts but prefer high quality almonds</li>
	<li>Eat broccoli and spinach</li>
	<li>Eat grass fed beef, Free range chicken, Salmon</li>
	<li>Eat eggs and whey protein (30g shake every morning)</li>
	<li>Improve brain function by taking krill oil, magnesium, B-complex, D3, oxaloacetate, vinpocetine</li>
	<li><a title="You Are Bigger Than Your Habits" href="http://mattparrett.com/2013/06/you-are-bigger-than-your-habits/">Cut myself some slack</a> on the diet rules once a week (free day)</li>
	<li>Take activated charcoal on free days for damage control</li>
</ul>

Now I'm focused on learning, growing, doing the right things, and inspiring others. I'm truly blessed and so thankful for this adventurous life. I hope my <a title="Good Habits in 5 Minutes or Less" href="http://mattparrett.com/2013/03/good-habits-in-5-minutes-or-less/">habits </a>reflect my gratitude.
