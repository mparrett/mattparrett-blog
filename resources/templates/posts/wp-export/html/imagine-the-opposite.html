Have you ever asked yourself these questions?

<em>How do I know if I'm still doing what I love?</em>
<em>Have I stopped following what excites me?</em>
<em>Am I drifting away from it?</em>

I recently got stuck trying to answer them. I tend to get stuck a lot when I'm asking these deeply introspective questions. These obvious (but elusive) questions are great to answer, because hidden treasures lie beyond the instant answers of self-justification and denial.

I thought for a moment. Part of me immediately blurted:

Of course I'm following my passion!

Immediately I was mired and frustrated. No clear answers were coming and I refused to believe what I was hearing.

To get beyond this mental hangup, I considered the opposites and came up with a top 10 list.

What would I do if I wanted to stop following my passion?

I'm was surprised by how quickly and easily the answers came.

<b>To stop following my passion...</b>
<ol>
	<li>Forget my values</li>
	<li>Forget or confuse my priorities</li>
	<li>Compromise my integrity</li>
	<li>React mindlessly to circumstances</li>
	<li>Blindly follow orders without thinking</li>
	<li>Focus on the destination, ignore the journey</li>
	<li>Isolate; keep everything to myself</li>
	<li>Act at the expense of others</li>
	<li>Confuse "urgent" with "important"</li>
	<li>Confuse "productive and busy" with "effective"</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">If I did all of these without failing, I'd certainly end up doing drifting away from what excites me. I'd end up doing something boring and feeling utterly miserable all the time. Now we're getting somewhere. Once I knew what the opposite looked like, I had a framework to reassess the original questions. With these insights, I created a checklist:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Do I know my values? Are they clear? Do I live by them with integrity?</li>
	<li>Are my priorities and goals clear? Do I prioritize and do what's important first?</li>
	<li>Are my actions effective and aligned with my vision, values, and goals?</li>
	<li>Have I been more proactive than reactive lately?</li>
	<li>Am I enjoying the journey, letting go of the outcome?</li>
	<li>Am I connected to others? Do I share with them? Do I have a positive impact on them?</li>
	<li>Have I produced meaningful results lately instead of just looking busy and feeling productive?</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">I was then able to spend some time answering the new questions. If our goal is to keep follow our passion, there is a spectrum of daily performance that must be considered. Our actions and mindset could lead us away if we're not careful. We must regularly assess our mindset and actions, and the results they are producing within a framework. Perhaps a framework like this. Then we can get a sense of whether we're moving away from what we love.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So, have I been doing it? Well, my performance hasn't been perfect, and that's a blessing. I'm mostly doing what I should, but I can do better. The old traps of desire and fear, chasing money, status, fame, and success are still there waiting to ensnare me. I do the best I can every day, knowing everything else will be taken care of. And I love it this way.

Are you moving toward or away from your passion?</p>
