<p dir="ltr">Yesterday I was asked to ponder a question, as part of the <a title="Momentum Challenge" href="http://momentumchallenge.net/" target="_blank">Momentum Challenge</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">What is your deepest reason for offering your gifts?</p>
<p dir="ltr">I started thinking about it. All the shifts I've experienced in the last few years. All the tough choices. I was having a hard time writing about it. I could tell this was going to take some effort. Any truly meaningful work is generally <a title="Old Habits Die Easy" href="http://mattparrett.com/2013/06/old-habits-die-easy/" target="_blank">met with resistance</a>. And based on that, this work is important.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Why do I choose sobriety? Why did I choose to start a family? Why do I write every morning? Why did I start blogging and sharing on Facebook? Why am I continually seeking the best version of myself and doing all these weird experiments? What drives me?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some answers came to mind. Yes I'd like to be successful. Yes, I'd like to build a business. Yes, I'd like to be happy. Yes, I'd like to be financially free. Or maybe I simply read a lot of self help books and bought into some new age belief that we are all creative loving beings, and we're just supposed to do this sort of thing. But something deeper told me this all missed the point. The truth is, it's not about me.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Maybe you're like I was. Stuck in a secure career but dying inside because your unique gifts are being wasted. Maybe you're suffering in a relationship and can't speak your truth. Maybe you're afraid of commitment. Maybe you've been conditioned to hide your creativity. Or maybe it's something else. <strong>Whatever it is, I know you want to be free.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">I used to be so sick that all I saw was darkness. I couldn't admit that maybe I had gone wrong in some deeply fundamental way. That's the nature of corruption. But I caught a glimpse of the light and I allowed it to change me. Because my way wasn't working and it was die or get better. And because others more awakened chose to love me first. When you taste that Love, it changes you forever.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is a lifelong journey. Perhaps an eternal one. Where you are is no better or worse than where I am. We're just in different places. If I can help you, that's great. And I know you can help me.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Even though I'm still afraid of revealing my imperfections, I choose to share. I choose to share my gifts because I'm alive.Â I know the world needs us and needs our art. The world needs to hear about <a title="We Will Find a Way" href="http://mattparrett.com/2013/06/we-will-find-a-way/" target="_blank">our victories</a>. I still have a lot of work to do. Thanks for allowing me to do some today.</p>
