Counterfactual simulation is a simple and effective business development strategy that requires only your brain. It costs nothing and gives you a new perspective on any problem you might be stuck with.

Start by asking a "what if" question, then generate ideas and capture the answers.

For example, I was recently stuck finding new ways to breathe new life into my business. So I asked myself about the opposite. I brainstormed quietly for a few minutes and generated a list of answers.
If I was destroying my business, I would...

- Ignore customers
- Operate without clear values
- Perpetuate a mindset of fear and scarcity
- Don't deliver what you promise
- Provide minimum value for maximum price (overoptimization)
- Allow interacting with the business to become dissatisfying, frustrating, or boring
- Sacrifice long-term success for short term gain
- Avoid change and innovation
- Stay busy, productive, and distracted
- Create a poor quality product or service
- Don't generate excitement about your offering
- Make it difficult to purchase

Once I had this list, I used it to honestly assess where I might be harming my business. I'm seriously guilty of a few, and the others serve as signposts to direct me toward the things I should be doing, even if they aren't clear.

Look at tough business problems from a "counterfactual" position to gain valuable insights. Once you identify the problem, start working on a solution. Stop doing things that destroy your business and you will succeed with less effort. Now go and do awesome!
