A fairly profound insight came to me when I was washing dishes this morning. I'm curious if any of you have had this lightbulb go off.

In a nutshell, a financial or economic model applies far outside its domain.

What does this mean? It means we can live beyond our means in our relationships, our careers, and everywhere else. I'm not even sure how far it extends, but my hunch is that it goes everywhere.


Every time you choose to shut down instead of open up... there's a price.

Every time you neglect your responsibilities for short term comfort... there's a price.

Every time you choose hate or anger instead of compassion... there's a price.

Pretty soon, you can find yourself drowning in debt. And all the same rules apply. Stop buying stuff you can't afford. Cut up the credit cards. And get on a payment plan. Know you've got some work to do before you're not paying interest anymore. And keep in mind it's a temporary setback and embrace the lesson.

The truth is, we never have a valid reason to withhold the best of ourselves... our love, our talents, our unique feelings and perspectives.

The lie is, there's only so much to go around. We only have so much energy and time for life. And by believing in this scarcity, we keep ourselves from expressing our innermost greatness, forever in debt.

So if you're in debt, like me, just realize it doesn't have to be that way. It might take some time to get out of the hole, but that's okay. Stop digging now and know you have a fantastically abundant future ahead of you. Where you are overflowing in every area... and you can and will invest in others... and in the world.
