Time management implies we have a limited amount of time to manage. There's an undertone of scarcity there. What's the truth?

"I don't have time" was a favorite excuse of mine. It was a mantra and defense mechanism wrapped into one. And absolutely not true.

What's actually true about time?

- We each get 24 hours a day. (Nobody has "more time" than anyone else)
- We have time in abundance. (Generally more time than we know what to do with)
- Time is experienced subjectively. (Engaging more of the senses and doing new things can give you more experience per moment of time)
- We automatically make time for what is important. (Think of the last time you took a vacation. You had all the time you needed to prepare)

When it feels like you don't have enough time, you usually just need to prioritize.

Modifying your internal speech can be very helpful. I catch myself saying "I don't have time" and remember the truth: "I don't want to right now" or "It's not a priority right now". Replace "I don't have time" with "I make time for what's important". You can use a list of simple actions to reinforce the idea "I automatically make time for what's important"

Create a list of important takes that take just minutes to execute. Then, when you feel like you don't have time, just pick one and make time for it.

My favorite excuse busters take only 5 minutes:

- Prioritize
- Review your goals
- Read an inspiring blog
- Go for a walk
- Stretch
- Reflect
- Pray
- List what you're grateful for
- Be quiet and still
- Focus on your breath
- Write insights and ideas
- Prepare a healthy snack

Simple practical strategies built on a truthful perspective of time are more effective than traditional time management.

You have all the time you need. Now go do awesome!
