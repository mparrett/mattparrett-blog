You might have some good habits, but does that mean you should stop growing?

Last month I was super excited for a challenge. Have you ever been so enthusiastic that you just radiate excitement and optimism everywhere you go? That was me. But the challenge didn't go the way I intended.

It was a tremendous learning experience and I'd be downright irresponsible if I didn't share.

Toward the end of April, I noticed my discipline eroding. Symptoms were everywhere. Dirty dishes filled the sink. Weeks went by between jiu jitsu training sessions. Important daily e-mails tasks were overlooked. I won't bore you with the rest of the list.

I desperately needed a boost.

I decided on an impromptu May Monastic Challenge. The challenge is the brainchild of my friend Kris Sharma. Since 2010, the Monastics (Kris, Mike,  Lisa, Drew, and myself) have been challenging each other to adhere to certain "monastic standards" for a month at a time. For example, we gave up eating meat, refined sugar, caffeine, sex, and alcohol for a month. The challenges have evolve as we have evolved.

This time, I wanted to commit to daily physical training and eating well (some form of paleo diet with no sugar, no wheat, no dairy). My goal was to start every day with a consistent routine including meditation/prayer, journaling, and planning. I've done several of these challenges, and they seem to get easier and easier. I knew it'd be a little tough, but not like the first one. I also knew by the end of the month my symptoms would clear up.

I was so excited that I started two days early. I logged my every move and it felt great. The best month of my life was about to unfold.

Then the sugar withdrawals hit along with a host of detox symptoms. The psychological drain and self-pity was intense. I was struggling like never before.

I watched myself fail in every way possible for several days.

Facing this seemingly impossible task, and feeling completely unmotivated, I wanted to just call it off. Maybe try again next month. But I then had an unexpected moment of clarity. What if, I intentionally gave in to my complete lack of discipline? At the very least, I'd learn something. What if I let go of all self-imposed restrictions for a month? I'd allow myself some freedom from my positive past conditioning. It sounded just crazy enough to work. But I was afraid it would ruin me. It went against everything I knew to do and I did it anyway. That's how the May Anti-Monastic Challenge was born.

This challenge was precisely the opposite of the past challenges.

I let some of my good convictions slide. Who in their right mind does this? I drank alcohol after 5 months of continuous abstinence. I stopped journaling every morning. I forgot my goals. I stopped my exercise routine and jiu jitsu training. I felt borderline insane. It was like that one time in Vegas, where we ate until we vomited. Except this went on for a solid month. If I'm being honest, it was pure gluttony. All forms of sugary treats were consumed in mass quantities. I drank 2 liters of mountain dew and had heart palpitations. How much time was I going  to spend in the hospital?

I ate gallons of ice cream, entire packages of cookies, and drank concerning amounts of chocolate milk. Entire boxes of donuts were gone in a flash. A deep dish pizza and several other pizzas were eliminated. A dozen burgers met their fate along with a dozen frozen custards and several pounds of french fries and tater tots. And so much cheese. So. Much. Cheese. And chili, corn dogs, hot pockets. The list goes on and on. How much weight would I gain?

My reinforced steel cable of discipline unraveled, each wet strand slithering onto the floor like a cold ramen noodle. I was constantly tempted to wallow in negativity and self-pity. But I remembered I chose this and I was going to be kind to myself. I just let go and failed to maintain consistency in any area. Everything from eating to journaling and meditation/prayer... it all slipped. And I allowed myself to not freak out.

What could I possibly learn from this stunt?

I learned a few things.

First, letting go was very fun and relaxing. I felt like a kid again. I didn't consciously think about calories or proper nutrition. As a kid, I loved pizza and donuts and I loved eating a dozen of anything at once. I remember regularly eating entire chocolate cakes. For the first time in years, I ate with complete abandon. It did not matter. If it sounded good, I ate it. My stomach was heavier, but my spirit was lighter.

Letting go was mildly toxic and poisonous. My physical and mental well-being were immediately impacted. It was impossible to ignore my mind dulling. My body became inflamed and my gut ached. My sleep quality was degraded. But I remembered I would ultimately detox.

Letting go was liberating. Discovering that I'd be OK even if I drop my daily routine for a month brought me a lot of joy. I didn't die and I was able to relax a little. I don't have to be terrified of slipping up and eating an entire cheesecake every now and then. My identity is bigger than my habits.

Letting go was educational. I learned more about what truly energizes and sustains me. I learned I need to take a break from strict discipline once in a while. I really don't have to fear potatoes and cheese.  Ice cream will not send me to an early grave. If I choose to drink, I don't end up in a ditch somewhere after a month-long bender.

I'm thankful for the experience, but I don't feel a need to repeat it any time soon. Freedom from self-imposed rules was a fantastic vacation and I learned a lot. It's a nice place to visit but I wouldn't want to live there.

It scares me to recommend this, but try letting go a little bit. Cut yourself some slack, break out of your mold, and see what happens. It's just an experiment. You might be surprised!
