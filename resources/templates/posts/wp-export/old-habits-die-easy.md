Do your habits die hard or die easy?

Right now I'm training a new habit: writing every morning. I've always written in some capacity, but never with consistency or discipline. So far, disciplined writing has been challenging. It's much easier to sleep in late or choose to browse cat pictures on the internet. Thankfully, I have great resources and I'm making progress.

We love habits that help us and hate those that bring us down. We want to change our habits but it's too hard. We want to form new ones, but we try and they escape us. Sometimes we are intimidated by the work and don't try at all.

Building new habits does require sustained effort. However, hard work can still be fun and rewarding. Is it possible that with the right approach and mindset, building new habits can be fun? If so, does that make it easier? If we take a closer look, we might see "hard" is a little softer than we first thought.

Sometimes we think we have to "break" bad habits. In my experience, this is near impossible. Now I approach my undesirable habits like you would monsters in a nightmare. If I fight them, I energize them. They become bigger and nastier. But when I focus on creating positive images and ignoring the bad ones, they become less threatening and simply fade away and disappear.Â I've been told that if I keep developing supportive habits, there won't be any "room" left for the negative ones.
Assume for a moment that changing habits is easy and fun. Which new habits would you form? Which existing habits would you like to see fade away?
Habit change can be easy and fun if you have the right process and mindset. In the past I was terrible at creating plans and following through. It was easier to settle for mediocrity and underachievement. I now have a passion for success and effective goal setting, and this knowledge makes changing habits a lot easier!

I wrote a simple checklist you can use to know whether you're setting yourself up for success or failure.

>"We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too." -- JFK

Now go create good habits and have fun!
