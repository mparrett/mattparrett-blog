I love books chock full of practical advice and I love books about using my brain more effectively.

In Your Brain at Work, David Rock describes practical strategies for overcoming distraction, regaining focus, and working smarter. By reading this book, you'll learn how to train your mind and use your brain more effectively. If you don't have time to read the book, you may glean some insight from simply reading this post.

David Rock gave a Google Tech Talk on the topic.

I'm a busy person and wanted to make the most of my time studying this gem. I made time to take notes and looked at the material from as many angles as possible.

First, I listened to the the audio book in my car. Then I read and copied the practical advice from Kindle. Finally, I revised and compiled the list below. I'm left with a nice (albeit oversimplified) reminder of the practical advice.
About thinking...

- Thought is a precious resource- conserve and allocate wisely.
- First, identify what is important. (Prioritize prioritizing)
- List all projects and tasks.
- Avoid draining activities like email.
- Schedule demanding tasks for when you are fresh.
- Schedule blocks of time for specific modes of thinking.
- Focus on important ideas first- they are harder to process.
- Externalize information and interact with it- don't store it.
- Create visuals for complex ideas.
- Simplify by approximation.
- Group copious information in chunks.
- Notice doing two things at once and slow down.
- Properly order decisions and thinking to reduce mental queues.
- Embed repetitive tasks.
- If multitasking is unavoidable, combine active thought only with embedded routines.
- Eliminate all external distractions.
- Clear your mind before difficult tasks.
- Inhibit distractions before they gain momentum.
- Practice mental and physical braking (inhibition).
- Be aware of your alertness and interest.

When stuck at an impasse...

- Extend your deadline and take a break.
- Do something fun, light, and interesting- see if an answer emerges.
- Quiet your mind to see subtle connections, links, and high level patterns.
- Reflect from a high level and avoid details.
- Simplify problems to their important features.
- Watch for the tickle of subtle connections that precede insight.
- Stop and focus when insight occurs.

Regarding emotions...

- Observe your emotions- notice states as they arise.
- Label emotional states to reduce arousal.
- Avoid emotional triggers and create plans for handling them.
- When strong emotions arise, re-appraise.
- When strong emotions arise, quickly move your attention elsewhere.
- Notice uncertainty or reduced autonomy creating a feeling of threat.
- Create a perception of choice and of autonomy.
- Reinterpret, reorder values, normalize, or change perspective.
- If anxious about your mental performance, say, "That’s just my brain."
- Recognize your expectations and set them a little lower.
- Find small ways to consistently exceed your expectations.
- When positive expectations are not met, say "That's just my brain."

Regarding others...

- Connect early when meeting someone new.
- Become friends with co-workers by sharing experiences.
- Encourage others to connect to improve collaboration.
- Be open about your actions to avoid triggering unfairness.
- Improve sensitivity to fairness by volunteering regularly.
- Punish unfairness.
- Watch out for fairness linking to certainty, autonomy, or relatedness, which can cause intense emotions.
- Watch out for people's status being threatened.
- Lower your status by sharing your humanity and mistakes.
- Give people positive feedback.
- Compete with yourself and pay attention to small improvements- feeling improvement generates a reward.
- Competing with yourself to improve your understanding of your brain is a powerful way to increase performance.
- Stop and pause before you give feedback, solve problems, or provide solutions.
- Help people think about their thinking.
- Help people focus on subtle thoughts without too much detail..
- Make giving self-feedback valuable.
- Reward people for being mindful.
- Watch emotional states when you are facilitating change.
- Avoid influencing when people are in a strong away state.
- Shift people into a toward state by using SCARF model.
- Focus attention on specific circuits you want to activate by using solution-focused questions.
- Create ways to consistently remind people of new circuits.

If you apply David Rock's suggestions, you will become more effective in business and in life. Bravo sir, bravo!
