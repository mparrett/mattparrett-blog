I've been thinking about starting a blog for about 6 years. During that time, I avoiding taking action and can cite countless excuses. I stayed blissfully inert, enjoying the comfort of survival mode, maintaining the status quo, and deftly avoiding or denying scary things. I've been truly terrified to put myself out there.

My fear kept me from finding my voice and sharing my life. Being vulnerable scares me. I could fail and be harshly criticized. I could be rejected. My potential success is even frightening. 

Today, I'm still afraid but there is a difference. Fear is my signal to act, my opportunity indicator. Jiu jitsu competitions taught me that champions act courageously in the face of fear. Fear will no longer beat me down every day. I'm "turning pro". I'm launching this blog and journeying into the unknown.

I'm glad you stopped by. Welcome to the adventure.
