A fairly profound insight came to me when I was washing dishes this morning. I'm curious if any of you have had this light bulb go off.

In a nutshell, the financial or economic model applies far outside its domain.

What does this mean? It means we earn, spend, and save... not just with money. But with some invisible currency of relationship to others, to the world, to Life. We can live beyond our means in our relationships, our careers, and everywhere else. I'm not even sure how far it extends, but my hunch is that it extends everywhere.

- When you show love for yourself and others... that's an investment.
- When you put someone else's needs before yours, that's an investment.
- When you choose to be aware and present instead of disconnected and distant... that's an investment.
- Every time you shut down emotionally instead of opening up... there's a price for that.
- Every time you neglect your responsibilities for short term comfort... there's a price for that.
- Every time you choose hate or anger instead of compassion... there's a price for that too.

If you're overspending, you will soon find yourself drowning in debt. And all the same rules apply. Stop buying stuff you can't afford. Cut up the credit cards. And get on a payment plan. Know you've got some work to do before you're not paying interest anymore. Before you can safely spend without overextending. And keep in mind your debt is a temporary setback and embrace the lesson.

The truth is, we never have a valid reason to withhold the best of ourselves... our love, our talents, our unique feelings and perspectives.

But the prevalent lie is, there's only so much to go around. We only have so much energy and time for life. And by believing in this scarcity, we keep ourselves from expressing our innermost greatness, forever in debt.

So if you're in debt, like me, just realize it doesn't have to be that way. It might take some time to get out of the hole, but that's okay. Stop digging now and know you have a fantastically abundant future ahead of you. Where you are overflowing in every area... and you can and will invest in others... in the world.

Happy Sunday!
